# Air-Monitoring-System

This project aims to develop an air parameter monitoring system that continuously measures specific air parameters and activates a buzzer when they exceed or fall below acceptable limits. The system provides real-time monitoring of air quality and helps ensure a safe and healthy environment.

# Features
1. Air parameter monitoring: The system measures specific air parameters, such as temperature, humidity, air quality index (AQI), or any other relevant parameters.
2. Buzzer activation: When any of the monitored parameters exceed or fall below the set limits, an onboard buzzer is activated to provide an audible alert.
3. Real-time data display: The system includes a display to show the current values of the monitored parameters, allowing users to monitor air quality at a glance.
4. Cost-effective design: The system is designed to be cost-effective, making it accessible for a wide range of users.

# Air Parameters
1. Humidity
2. Temperature
3. PM2.5 - Suspended particulate matter in air
4. Carbon monoxide (CO)
5. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
6. Ammonia (NH3)
7. Ozone (03)
8. VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)
